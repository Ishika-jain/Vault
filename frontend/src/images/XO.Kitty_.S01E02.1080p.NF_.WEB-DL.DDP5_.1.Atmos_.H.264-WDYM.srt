1
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,723
This is Dae. My boyfriend.

2
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,652
- Whoa!
- Excuse me.

3
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,530
Sorry. This can't be happening.

4
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,207
Dae, I don't wanna talk to you.
Just leave me...

5
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,211
Sorry. I'm just looking for the loo.

6
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:51,885
I'm Alex Finnerty
from Melbourne, Australia.

7
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,262
I'm a new teacher here this year.

8
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,473
Why are you not Dae?

9
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,101
You mean the guy you don't wanna talk to?

10
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,314
Thank you.

11
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,483
- Did Kitty really leave?
- Yup.

12
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,610
Ugh, this is a nightmare.

13
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,239
Dae Heun Kim, get it together.

14
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,409
Even Mihee and Eunice asked me
about what was up with you and Kitty.

15
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,788
Tell your followers that
what I do is none of their business.

16
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,125
Well, now your business
is going to be my business too.

17
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,645
You know I told my mom
we've been dating since the summer, right?

18
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,606
You know you only told me that
four hours ago, right?

19
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,857
So can you stop looking for Kitty

20
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,966
and please start acting
like you're my boyfriend?

21
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,259
Everyone's watching.

22
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,346
Well, someone had a hot boy summer.

23
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,975
- Do you know where Juliana is?
- No. She hasn't texted back.

24
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,059
I'll call her.

25
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,820
<i>The number you are
trying to reach is no longer in service.</i>

26
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:55,323
<i>The number you are trying to reach
is no longer in service.</i>

27
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,285
Are you all right?
Can I get you anything?

28
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,746
- Never mind.
- You're American, right?

29
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,375
- Yes.
- I really admire you guys over there.

30
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,085
<i>Why isn't Dae running after me?</i>

31
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,962
- ...also very loud.
- What?

32
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:12,590
I noticed that Americans speak louder
than everyone else.

33
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,343
Forget everything that just happened.

34
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,683
I am going back in there
and I am not leaving without answers.

35
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,408
Excuse me.

36
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,287
This girl treats Korean guys like Pokémon.
She's trying to catch them all.

37
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,125
- Not interested.
- Get over yourself. I'm looking for Dae.

38
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,628
- Hey, can we stop now?
- No, we can't stop.

39
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,547
And here's why.

40
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,092
- Hello, Ms. Jeon!
- Yuri, hello.

41
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,761
Dae, we just got your tuition.

42
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,015
Things must have worked out.
What a relief!

43
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,724
Thank you.

44
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,687
You paid for the whole quarter?

45
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,273
Yep. I told you when we made our deal
that I'd figure it out.

46
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,400
I thought you meant
like a few hundred bucks.

47
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,986
Yeah, so now you really owe me.

48
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,571
Okay, who are you?

49
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,531
I'm Kitty Song Covey.

50
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,532
You're Kitty?

51
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,079
Wait, are you Q?

52
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,832
Track star, fellow American,
heart of gold?

53
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,044
Guilty as charged. I feel like
we should hug right now. Should we?

54
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,630
Maybe later. I need to find Dae.

55
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,506
So you're the pen pal?

56
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,845
If he's Q, then you must be Min Ho.

57
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,681
Of course you are.

58
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,433
Where's Dae?

59
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,101
All right, fine...

60
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,829
But why do you even need a fake boyfriend?

61
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:53,775
You think your mom will be glad to know
you were seduced by her chauffeur's son?

62
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,320
Ew.

63
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,072
You seduce me?

64
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,325
Mom will think
I'm doing this for attention

65
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,661
and tell me
to break up with you immediately.

66
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,997
Still, it'll be better
than if she knew the truth.

67
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,253
Fine. Let's talk with her now and get this
over with. I hate hurting Kitty.

68
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,924
You can make up with her tomorrow.

69
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,468
Tonight, you're mine.

70
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,910
It's a dream come true
for me. I'm a huge K-pop fan.

71
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,689
My karaoke song list
is exclusively in Korean.

72
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,107
Oh.

73
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,111
Oh, Yuri, this is Madison,
the Millers' daughter.

74
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,447
Your father's having dinner
with her parents to discuss business.

75
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,699
Nice to meet you.

76
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,992
- Hello.
- Oh!

77
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,704
- Mom, you know Dae.
- Of course I know Dae.

78
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:52,208
- One of our best students.
- And my boyfriend.

79
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,292
Hello.

80
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,840
You're dating your tutor?

81
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,717
You said he's one of our best students.

82
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,803
- That's why he's your tutor.
- Oh, juicy.

83
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,055
I hope you're not angry, Ms. Ho Lim.

84
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,600
Of course I'm not angry.

85
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,562
Like I said,
Dae is one of our best students.

86
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,772
Great.

87
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,735
So did you get in touch
with Juliana's parents?

88
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,404
Yes, everything's fine.
We'll talk about it later.

89
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,573
- But...
- Madison, I want to introduce you

90
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,451
to our Korean language teacher,
Professor Chae.

91
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:30,538
- She'll be so impressed with you.
- Then why isn't Juliana here?

92
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,250
- What the hell is going on?
- It's not what it looks like.

93
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,044
It looks like you're a cheater.

94
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,671
Are you not upset?
He's been cheating on both of us.

95
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,633
No, he's been cheating on you.
I knew about you already.

96
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,177
Dae's American pen pal.

97
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,346
I didn't know you were you this morning.

98
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,807
Yuri, can we get a photo?

99
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,443
Sorry, I'm late.

100
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,779
You're here now, darling.

101
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,617
Is Yuri dating our driver's son?

102
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,956
Is this...

103
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,542
lettuce?

104
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,714
<i>So this is my answer.</i>

105
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,927
<i>I fell for a guy who was a total liar,
a total fake.</i>

106
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,639
<i>I can't believe I wasted years of my life
being in love with this person.</i>

107
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,518
Whoa!

108
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,693
What? Never seen a girl
crash into a dessert tower before?

109
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,571
Nothing to see here, people!

110
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,574
Oh!

111
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,291
Fine, maybe there is something to see.

112
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,295
- Kitty, are you okay?
- Get away from me.

113
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,008
<i>♪ I wish I left all my things
At your place ♪</i>

114
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,261
<i>♪ So I could come get them ♪</i>

115
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,180
<i>♪ And say that we could make exceptions ♪</i>

116
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,350
<i>♪ I just can't take the rejection... ♪</i>

117
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:19,522
<i>Thank you for calling
Asianair. For Korean, press one.</i>

118
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,524
<i>For English, press two.</i>

119
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,777
<i>A representative
will be ready to assist you momentarily.</i>

120
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,572
<i>Just breathe, Kitty.
You can go home.</i>

121
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,824
<i>You don't have to die here
from a broken heart.</i>

122
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:34,245
<i>Your current wait time
is 70 minutes. Please continue to hold.</i>

123
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,265
Spill it!

124
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,440
When did you get with Yuri? And where?

125
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:07,487
- And how far?
- And most importantly, why?

126
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,991
Dae, you little scammer.

127
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,074
Dae?

128
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,077
How did you convince Yuri
to buy you that suit?

129
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,246
How do you know I didn't buy it?

130
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,290
Because it costs 5K.

131
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:26,714
- Seriously?
- I don't know. I feel bad for Kitty.

132
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,133
- I don't.
- That's cold, Min Ho.

133
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,719
Breaking up with someone is brutal.

134
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,890
Except it wasn't a breakup
because it wasn't a real relationship.

135
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,810
No one's gonna blame you for upgrading
a pen pal for an actual girlfriend.

136
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,860
Marius?

137
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,657
No, no, no.

138
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,537
I thought Marius went back to Greece.

139
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,164
- Maybe he changed his mind.
- Hmm.

140
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,502
Oy, Marius. Wake up! Time for class!

141
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,089
A little help.

142
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,145
Dae's crazy ex-pen pal
broke into our dorm to murder us.

143
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,897
This is my room.

144
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,696
- You're listed as Song Covey.
- So?

145
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:35,283
Song can be a guy's name. That's why
they assigned you to the guys' dorm.

146
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,366
What?

147
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:43,666
She did this on purpose.
To be closer to Dae and me.

148
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,293
- Okay.
- I told you lot,

149
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,670
she was hitting on me
on the plane ride over.

150
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:51,424
- I was not hitting on you.
- Kitty.

151
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,843
Can we please talk?

152
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,346
No, I never wanna speak to you again.

153
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,517
- Kitty.
- I want my necklace back.

154
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,353
Your necklace?

155
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,274
Yeah, the one I gave you
when your mom died.

156
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,986
Yeah, I have it around here somewhere.

157
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,322
Somewhere?

158
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,490
I'll find it.

159
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:20,202
You don't even know where it is.
Dae, that belonged to my mom.

160
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,204
I'll bring it back to you, Kitty.

161
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,956
I promise.

162
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,793
Your promises are literally worthless.

163
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,468
All of Dae's stuff is in
the room. Where's he going to sleep?

164
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,607
Here, man.

165
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,484
Great.

166
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,239
I know you're trying to be a hero by
letting that tourist crash here tonight,

167
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,450
but this isn't a hostel.

168
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,369
Hostels are filled with friendly people.

169
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,080
I'm friendly to my friends.

170
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,584
You somehow managed to land
the only daughter in one of the richest,

171
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,711
most well-connected families in the world.

172
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,795
Full stop.

173
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,298
Don't blow it.

174
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,348
You also have the love of your life
20 feet away from you.

175
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,392
Don't blow that.

176
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,251
Quit hogging the blanket.

177
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:09,663
Siri, play "Reykjavik New Year's Eve Mix."

I'll be at the airport by 9 a.m.
for the standby seat.

192

<i>Wait. Is that...?</i>

<i>Wait.</i>

195
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,087
<i>Is this a sign that I should stay?</i>

196
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,892
Kitty, me and Yuri, it's not real.
It's all fake.

197
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,521
Will you just open the door?
I can explain.

198
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,690
Begging is not a good look.

199
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,945
I wasn't begging.
I was just trying to get my pants.

200
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:51,784
Listen, you squatter, we have to get
ready for the first day of school.

201
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,746
Don't make us late.

202
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,960
And she's gone.

203
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,043
Sweet.

204
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,755
Dae, don't worry about it. We'll...

205
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,971
<i>President Han?
That guy is way too extreme.</i>

206

he can't throw fits like that.</i>

<i>Every single person deserves respect.</i>

208
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,605
<i>No one deserves that kind of abuse.</i>

209
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,733
Fortunately,
it's only on the Korean news, sir.

210
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,027
President Han?

211
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,655
It's actually also on the BBC right now-

212
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,449
- Huh?
- Not the BBC!

213

<i>CEO Sung-jin Han

Whoa, that was fast.

224
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,739
You ungrateful, spoiled little brat!

225
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,574
Are you trying to ruin me?

226
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,368
Do you realize
you are destroying our family?

227
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,122
This is why we should never
have raised her abroad.

228
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,498
She has no respect!

229
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,458
Calm down.

230
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,020
<i>If there's any hope of closing this deal,</i>

231
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,129
<i>Mr. Han will have to do damage control...</i>

00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,505
Turn that off!

233
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,970
President Han,
what if we hire back that chef?

234
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,515
Whatever I do right now
will only look performative.

235
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,060
I have a solution.

236
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:48,776
Your one precious daughter

237
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,404
has been dating
your chauffeur's son all summer.

238
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:56,158
And you welcomed him with open arms.

239
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,786
- I did?
- Yes.

240
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,580
Invited him to your home.

241
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:07,211
And your workplace too.

242
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,174
When should we call the press conference?

243
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,135
- President Han, how about tomorrow?
- Do it immediately.

244
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,553
Yes, sir.

245
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,058
You go get dressed right now.

246
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,526
Kitty!

247
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,406
I've been all over campus
trying to find you.

248
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,537
Listen, what you saw yesterday, me...

249
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,622
Sorry.

250
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,957
Um...

251
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,667
The truth is that...

252
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,172
- Why is she calling me?
- 'Cause she's your girlfriend.

253
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,092
No. Just let me explain, Kitty.

254
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,175
No.

255
00:18:56,218 --> 00:19:00,222
After everything, there's nothing
you can say that's gonna make me stay.

256
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,231
Maybe there's something I can do.

257
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,957
<i>It's happening.</i>

258
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,294
Dae Heun!

259
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,882
- Dad?
- Dad?

260
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,405
Finally. A word I know.

261
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,886
- Your dad is Yuri's driver? I thought...
- Sorry.

262
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,656
- What are you doing here?
- President Han is looking for you.

263
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,598
Why me?

264
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,892
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Let's get going.

265
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,728
- Wait, one moment, I need to talk...
- No, no, we have to get going.

266
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,811
No...

267
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:57,112
President Han, your daughter
seems to have paid Dae Heun's tuition.

268
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,991
It seems her feelings for him are sincere.

269
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,911
We'll take over the payments.
As part of his new internship.

270
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,247
- Internship?
- Yes, sir.

271
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,876
And here's the NDA for him to sign.

272
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,506
Why is he wearing pajamas outside?

273
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,510
- You.
- Yes?

274
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,054
Take off your suit.

275
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,223
My... My suit?

276
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,184
Hey, we've got to go
to the press conference.

277
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,144
What press conference?

278
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:34,441
You said I could make up
with Kitty tomorrow. Tomorrow's now today.

279
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,235
Our deal is over.

280
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,446
The situation has changed.

281
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,997
We have some important
family business now,

282
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,916
otherwise I'd offer you a ride.

283
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,335
But I'd be happy to call you a Kakao taxi.

284
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,212
Hard pass.

285
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,385
Well, bon voyage.

286
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,707
<i>It is important for me
to own up to all my decisions...</i>

287
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,128
Dae, have you seen this video?
It's kind of blowing up.

288
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,380
I bet Yuri's loving this drama.

289
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,257
I don't particularly care.

290
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,675
Kitty.

291
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:46,972
- I thought you left.
- I did, but then I decided to stay.

292
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:51,935
And not that it's any of your business,
but this isn't all about a boy.

293
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,229
Oh, sweetie.

294
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,773
My mom went here, and...

295
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:02,070
I don't know, being here just makes me
feel closer to her than I ever have.

296
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,154
And...

297
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,741
Wait, Dae's on TV?

298
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,993
<i>...but for my wife, and my daughter.</i>

299
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,995
<i>Family means everything to me.</i>

300
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:14,166
And so, I'd like to apologize
for my behavior.

301
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:23,258
<i>Dae looks miserable.
Something about this isn't right.</i>

302
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,929
<i>Today, I'm announcing
the Han Hotel Youth Internship Program.</i>

303
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,560
The first intern is Dae Heun Kim.

304
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,439
Son of my longtime driver.

305
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:41,568
A top student
at Korean Independent School of Seoul.

306
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:47,032
And he also happens to be
dating my daughter, Yuri.

307
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,410
<i>Any questions? Yes.</i>

308
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:55,040
Thank you. Actually,
this question is for Dae Heun Kim.

309
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:07,135
I'm just curious. Do you believe
Mr. Han is being sincere

310
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,471
and not using you to repair his image?

311
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,015
Yeah. Um...

312
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,522
I believe Mr. Han means what he said.

313
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,357
Um...

314
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,985
He will do better.

315
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,905
So...

316
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,326
"lettuce" move on.

317
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,374
Thank you.

318
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,044
Well played.

319
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,383
Oh, my God.

320
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,137
He's faking it.

321
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,557
That's a fake relationship.
